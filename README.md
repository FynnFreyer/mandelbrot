# mandelbrot
Renders the mandelbrot set in p5js. Just open in a browser, and wait a bit until calculations are done.

You can change the resolution by adjusting width and height. This is not really an efficient implementation, so don't crank up the resolution and wonder why it's not rendering, it will take a while.
